## Model company - Dashboarding
Introduction
You are commissioned by a company selling models and scale models. The
company already has a database that lists employees, products, orders, and much
more. You are invited to browse and discover this database. The director of the
company wishes to have a dashboard which he could refresh each morning to have
the latest information in order to manage the company

## Objective
Your dashboard should revolve around these 4 main topics: sales, finance, logistics,
and human resources.
Here are the indicators that should be present in your dashboard. Visualizations
would also be appreciated. And you are invited to practice your advisory role, by
proposing additional KPIs and charts.
- Sales: The number of products sold by category and by month, with comparison
and rate of change compared to the same month of the previous year.
- Finances:
- The turnover of the orders of the last two months by country.
- Orders that have not yet been paid.
- Logistics: The stock of the 5 most ordered products.
- Human Resources: Each month, the 2 sellers with the highest turnover.
Nota bene: sometimes business indicators are not technically achievable. It is up to
you to explain it, and to bring your own ideas to answer the business needs.

## Tools
The manager does not want to do SQL, he wants to be able to access the data
automatically and graphically. You can therefore propose a tool of your choice, as
long as the dashboard is relevant.
For information, the database is available on a company server. You can access it in
read-only mode with a user provided below.
The company also provides you with the script that you can run on your local MySQL
server. The data are identical, and it stops at the end of the previous month. On the
morning of the demo, the data will be refreshed with new and fresh data (and you will
be able to receive the update script if you do it locally). The demo should therefore
display the latest available data.
